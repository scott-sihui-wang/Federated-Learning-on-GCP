time_number_number: the numbers combined together is the training time. For example, 785.694 is time_785_694
filename ended with Full_P: all 3 clients are chosen in each epoch
filename ended with _1_3: only 1 client is chosen in each epoch
filename ended with _2_3 or nothing: 2 clients are chosen in each epoch
filename started with ineq_FL: For Figure 12
filename started with straggler: It is not in the report. This is the result on 4 machines with different hardware configurations
