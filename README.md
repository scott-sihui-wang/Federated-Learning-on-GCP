# Federated Learning on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Topics:** _Cloud and Distributed Computing_, _Synchronous and Asynchronous Federated Learning_

**Skills:** _Google Cloud Platform_, _Federated Learning_, _Python_

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

This is the course project for CMPT 756: `Distributed and Cloud Systems`.

In this project, I implemented and evaluated some of `synchronous` and `asynchronous` `gradient aggregation algorithms` on a small cluster of computers deployed on `Google Cloud Platform` (GCP).

I also discussed how `clients' partial participation`, `reduced level of synchronization`, and `the presence of stragglers` might impact `communication efficiency` and `model accuracy` of `federated learning` algorithms.

For full technical details of this project, please refer to my [report](FinalReport.pdf).
