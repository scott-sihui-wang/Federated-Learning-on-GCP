These are all adaptions that I have made to the codes.

library side:
overwrite the code:
 flower installation folder/server/app.py, /server/server.py, /server/strategy/__init__.py with the corresponding file
add fedpaq.py to /server/strategy

user side:
the original code: https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/quickstart_pytorch
overwrite the code:
client.py, server.py
